I built a game using the pygame library. The game is called Spaceship Duels and it utilizes the arrow keys, the right shift key, the WASD keys and the q key. I will be adding a main menue to it with a page that lists the instructions. Feel free to download the source code and edit it in any way you would like. However, if you are going to be using the code for a purpose other than your own private amusement, please give me credit by linking my github profile. I would enjoy looking at the edits anybody made to the code myself so dont hesitate to show me your edits! I am also open to feedback and advice and will greatly appreciate helpful suggestions.
